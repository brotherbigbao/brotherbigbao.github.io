- Conditional tests (e.g., conditions in control structures) consider both the Boolean false and nil
  as false and anything else as true. In particular, Lua considers both zero and the empty string as true in
  conditional tests.
  
- A useful Lua idiom is x = x or v, which is equivalent to
```lua
if not x then x = v end
```
- The not operator always gives a Boolean value:
```
 > not nil --> true
 > not false --> true
 > not 0 --> false
 > not not 1 --> true
 > not not nil --> false
```
